# 👋 Hey, I’m Abhishek<>

> I don’t just write code — I design systems that *think, scale, and survive*.

## 🚀 About Me (Short, Sharp, Human)

I’m a **Full Stack & Cloud-Native Engineer** who loves turning complex ideas into **clean, production-ready systems**.  
My work lives at the intersection of **Backend Engineering, DevOps, AI, and System Design**.

I believe:
- Clean architecture > clever hacks  
- Automation > repetition  
- Understanding *why* > memorizing *how*

---

## 🧠 What I’m Currently Building

🔹 **Cloud-native microservices** with Spring Boot & Python  
🔹 **AI-powered systems** (OCR, ML pipelines, GenAI apps)  
🔹 **DevSecOps pipelines** with CI/CD, monitoring & security baked in  
🔹 **Blockchain & cryptography-based systems** for secure data flow  

> I focus on **real-world problems**, not toy projects.

## 📈 Engineering Mindset

✔ System design before coding  
✔ Scalability & fault tolerance matter  
✔ Security is not optional  
✔ Documentation is part of the product  

I write code assuming **someone else will maintain it tomorrow**.
